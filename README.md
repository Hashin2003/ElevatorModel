3-Level Elevator Automation

This project automates a 3-level elevator model using Ladder Logic Programming as part of my PLC programming course at SLIR (Sri Lanka Institute of Robotics). Only the programming part was done by me. The elevator responds to button presses for floor selection and moves up or down accordingly. Key features include:
- User-controlled floor selection via button press
- Elevator moves up or down to the selected floor
- Implemented using Ladder Logic for PLC control
